KH:CoM Battle Card Randomizer

FAQ:
Q: What is this?
A: This is a romhack of Kingdom Hearts: Chain of Memories. Basically, a Lua script randomly changes around various battle cards in the game.
 
Q: What do you mean?
A: An example is probably best. If Kingdom Key gets replaced with, say, Ultima Weapon, then your starting deck will consist of Ultima Weapons. Every time you would get a Kingdom Key--through drops or shops--you now get an Ultima Weapon.
 
Q: What stuff gets randomized?
A: The randomization is split into three groups: attack and magic, item and summon, and enemy cards. The cards are randomized within each group but not across groups (due to technical limitations). For example, Kingdom Key could be replaced with Oblivion or Fire but not with Potion or Bambi.
